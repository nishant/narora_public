### Data Scraping and Cleaning ###
This project involves:
Scraping and preparing each of two datasets (NASA and SpaceWeatherLive)
Integrate the two datasets (including some Entity Resolution)
Exploratory Analysis

### Interactive Data Map ###
This project takes Baltimore Crime Data and groups it into 4 different types (Drugs, Assualt, Theft, Other).
Each crime data point is plotted on a map by latitude and longitude and is color coded by type of crime.
When a data point is clicked, a more detailed summary is shown.
The data can be selectively filtered by type of crime.

### Mass Shooting Analysis ###
This project uses data from the Stanford MSA, a dataset that records Mass Shooting Analytics for the United States.
I also used population data for each state to draw connections between mass shootings and state/shootings per capita.
This is a in-depth analysis of mass shooting attributes such as shooter age, gender, number of fatalites, location, etc.

### Regression and Classification ###
This project has 2 parts. The first involves experimenting with linear regression using data from gapminder.org to explore
how life expectancy has changed over 50 years across the world, and how economic measures like gross domestic product (GDP) 
are related to it.

The second part involves Mortgage Affordability data from Zillow to experiment with classification algorithms. 
The data was downloaded from Zillow Research page: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
We will answer the question "Is a random forest better than logistic regression?"

### Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis ###
In this project we use data wrangling and exploratory data analysis skills to learn about baseball data. 
In particular, we want to know how well did Moneyball work for the Oakland Aâ€™s. Was it worthy of a movie?
