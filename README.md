Nishant Arora's Public Projects

### Data Aggregator ###
This is a Ruby program that reads large volumes of time series data to gain valuable insights. The program efficiently records, parses, and categorizes data to display meaningful results to the viewer.

### Data Science (folder) ###
This is a collection of all of my data science projects. Visit this folder to see a readme for each project.

### Genmake ###
Genmake is a program that searches the source code directory tree and creates/updates a makefile that can build all of the code in the source directory. It can automatically create a Makefile for any C program.

### Parser/Interpreter ###
This is a two-part project in which I implemented a lexer and parser for the SmallC language in OCaml. The parser is capable of parsing expressions, statements, and full programs by operating on a flat token list assembled by the lexer. In this project, I have written the complete pipeline to turn a text file into a running SmallC program.

### Sample UI ###
Contains HTML and CSS code for a sample UI for a website homepage.

### Simple Shell ###
A simple shell in C that supports boolean operations, pipes, and file redirection.
Implemented functionality of basic UNIX commands (ls, cd, mkdir, pwd, etc.) 

### Website ###
Contains code for my work-in-progress personal website @ www.abncode.com
